# Ad-Blocker-Testing-Suite

A lightweight HTML-based test suite for checking how different ad-blockers react to ads, trackers, and other common web annoyances.  
This project provides a simple environment to see which elements get blocked (or slip through).

---

## 🚀 Features
- Multiple ad-like elements (banners, popups, inline ads).
- Tracker and script simulation.
- Easy to expand with your own test cases.
- 100% HTML/CSS/JS — no server required.

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- `index.html` → main testing page
- `assets/` → images, styles, and mock ads
- `scripts/` → sample tracking/ad scripts

---

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Enable/disable your ad-blocker.
4. Compare what’s hidden, blocked, or still visible.

---

## 📌 Why?
Ad-blockers behave differently depending on their filter lists.  
This suite helps you:
- Learn how ad-blockers work.
- Debug your own site’s compatibility.
- Experiment with web privacy tools.
